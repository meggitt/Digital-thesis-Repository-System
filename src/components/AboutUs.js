                        <h2>Our History</h2> {/* History section */}

                        The Digital Thesis Repository was established in 2024 by a group of passionate graduate students aiming to create a centralized platform for academic research and collaboration. What started as a small-scale project has evolved into a robust system utilized by students and faculty alike. Over the years, we have continuously improved the platform's features and expanded its reach, making it easier for researchers from all disciplines to store, share, and engage with scholarly work.
